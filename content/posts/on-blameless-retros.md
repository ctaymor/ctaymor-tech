This post is influenced by some recent retros I've been in, as well as Rachel Andrew's post here: https://the-pastry-box-project.net/rachel-andrew/2018-february-7 and Jess Rudder's RubyConf talk: https://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2017-the-good-bad-bug-fail-your-way-to-better-code

- if the solution is "people should do better next time", your retro is blame-ful.
- not naming names doesn't making a retro blameless
- What IS the point of a blameless retro?
	- The goal of a blameless retro is to create a culture where people feel safe admitting their mistakes, so that the underlying causes of the mistakes can be addressed and similar mistakes prevented in the future.
	- Requirements:
		- Feel safe
		- No punishment (including shame) for admitting mistakes
		- time and curiosity into the systemic causes of the mistake
		- action items which address the systemic causes and not the individual actions
