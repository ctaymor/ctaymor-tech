Across the sea of space, the stars are other suns.

Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.

Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.
