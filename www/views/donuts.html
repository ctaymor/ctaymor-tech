        <p>Inspired by <a href="http://larahogan.me/donuts/">Lara Hogan</a> and <a href="https://beero.ps/cupcakes/">Katherine Daniels</a>, I have decided to start marking professional accomplishments with donuts (and photographic evidence of said donuts). It's far too easy not to notice how you've grown in your career. I've always marked raises and new jobs with some sort of celebration (usually dinner out), but there are a lot of other accomplishments worth marking which are not as noticable. I hope that by marking them with donuts, I will stop to notice these moments, and appreciate the work and growth I've done.</p>
