Have you ever gotten really stuck while trying to understand the cause of a bug? Thinking of your debugging session as a science experiment, and using the scientific method can help you make progress again. Come and learn how to adapt the scientific method (the process used for scientific research) to get past that stuck place and find the cause of bugs or production incidents. Youâ€™ll walk away with a great new tool to keep you calm and focused in the face of inevitable bugs.

There is also a [reference guide]({{< base_url >}}/posts/getting-unstuck/) to accompany this talk
