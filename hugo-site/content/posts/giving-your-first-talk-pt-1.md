1. clicker
1. give it at a meetup in advance
1. outlines are helpful
	* I tried not really outlining, and my talk was a mess
1. Ask specific feedback from friends or coworkers
	* Also say what not to give feedback on. (For instance, I know I will change this, no need to comment on it.)
	* I'm worried about this, can you help?
