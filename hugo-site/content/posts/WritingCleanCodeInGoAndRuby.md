I. Intro
II. I think I'm missing something about Go, maybe I'm writing bad go
After a few months of writing Golang, coming from a Ruby background, I started to wonder what I was missing about Go. A big part of learning Ruby was learning from more experienced Rubyists how I was doing it wrong and could do better. It was kind, and it helped me learn. The one that stands out most in my mind was the coworker who taught me to use the relevant Enumerable method (such as each_with_object for building a collection) instead of always using each.

At some point, I started feeling like I was plateauing a bit technically. In part, I was spending more time thinking about running a successful team and how we could conquer our project's significant tech debt. Writing better code wasn't the top of my mind, but I felt like as I no longer had teammates with significantly more Ruby experience than me, and instead was teaching Ruby to folks coming from other linguisting backgrounds, I needed more outside resources. Eventually, I started seeking out books and blogposts on writing good Ruby. A few favorites included Sandi Metz's books 99 Bottles of OOP and POODR were faves, and I've spent a lot of time with Refactoring Ruby by Jay Fields, Shane Harvie, and Martin Fowler. Reading books about writing good Ruby was vital to me. I could see the code I wrote improve over incredibly short time frames. A week, or two, made leaps of improvement.

I recently moved to a team writing Golang. I'd written Go for a few weeks in school, so I knew just enough to not be totally lost, but very little about writing *good* Go. For the first couple months, I learned everything I felt I needed to from work projects and pairing with teammates, or looking up questions that came up naturally during the work.

However, after a few months, I started to wonder why I wasn't hearing the same sorts of feedback on making my Golang more idiomatic. It seemed like writing idiomatic Ruby was a big concern when I worked with extremely skilled Rubyists. I started looking for writing on how to write good, idiomatic Go. 

Certainly, many of the lessons I learned writing Ruby still apply. Just the other day, I used the technique of implementing a larger refactor in a manner by keeping the tests green with every single 1-2 line change that I learned from 99 Bottles of OOP. However, the Go specifics of writing idiomatic code were lacking.

I started asking people who wrote Go for references on writing better more idiomatic Go. I talked with my manager
III. Maybe Go just makes itself easy to write
IV. I think it's in-between
V. Conclusion
