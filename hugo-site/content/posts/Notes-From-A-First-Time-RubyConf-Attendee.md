Day 1:
- everyone is very friendly
- fave talks: ashley ellis pierce on refactoring with git
	- i knew the solid design principles but she helped me learn how to see violations of them in my code
	Chad Fowler's keynote on building legacy software
- alone time in a giant conf is a must -thank goodness for the speakers lounge
- don't feel pressured to attend every talk. I was much better able to absorb the talks after spending a quiet hour or two midday working on my talks
- thank goodness for the speaker dinner, or I would be totally overwhelmed. Knowning a few friendly faces already makes a huge difference. Also, being a speaker makes me feel like the impetus is on me to be welcoming to others which makes it easier to not be shy
- you want a hardbound notebook! my soft cover moleskin is really hard to take notes in. And the grid is impossible to see in dim rooms, so my notes wander all over the page
- Be the friendly face you want to see in the world!
