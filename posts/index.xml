I exceeded that goal in spades. I&amp;rsquo;ve given my talk &amp;ldquo;Getting Unstuck: Using the Scientific Method for Debugging&amp;rdquo; 5 times, gotten paid to speak, and 600-700 people have seen my talk in person or on video. I also burned out on speaking, and resolved to stop giving talks. Then I changed my mind.
Why speak?</description></item><item><title>Getting Unstuck - Reference Guide</title><link>https://tech.taymor.io/posts/getting-unstuck/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tech.taymor.io/posts/getting-unstuck/</guid><description>Are you excited to try using the scientific method for debugging? This is a short reference sheet to refer back to the next time you get stuck in a debugging session, to make the most of the scientific method framework.
This guide comes from my talk &amp;ldquo;Getting Unstuck: Using the Scientific Method for Debugging&amp;rdquo;. Slides can be found here. Video of the talk is coming soon.

I hit a few snags trying to automate this site with TravisCI and Google App Engine, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my process.
Build a Hugo app, make it work locally I&amp;rsquo;ll handwave over this a bit.</description></item></channel></rss>
