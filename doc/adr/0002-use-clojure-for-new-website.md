# 2. Use Clojure for new website

Date: 2025-06-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

My old website was written in hugo. It was so old and outdated that it was getting hard to update or change. And the website itself was years out of date. I'm doing more bizdev for consulting and needed a more up to date website

I had heard that clojure is designed to be "cellar proof.

## Decision

Rewrite website in clojure, using Claude.ai as an assistant/pair to help me learn clojure.

## Consequences
Hopefully, infrequent maintenence will be easier. Most deicsions will be made with: "how will I figure out what's going on after stepping away for a year or two" in mind.

The new website will run on newer technology. It also gives me a chance to start fresh with design and layout, now that I'm consulting, instead of working at Pivotal.
